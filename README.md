Memory-efficient ID type and ID generator (MapReduce approach).

 * Input: 
 in: input file
 out: output file where the ids batch will be stored for further audit
 iterations: number of IDs to be generated in the batch
 
 * Output: 
 Ids are printed for analysis purpose
 The batch is stored in partitions inside the <out> folder
